Cribbage Implementation:
 - edge case where a player can play multiple cards in a row (staying under 31),
    while the other player can't make a move
    
Move-Selection Algorithms to Implement (in order):
- Expectiminimax
- Expectiminimax w/ pruning
(maybe just experiment w/ move ordering instead of MCTS)
- Monte Carlo
