Cribbage Implementation to finish:

- plr-hands?  how do i get them when after the play / during the show ?
- figure out how to accurately use GO-SCORE (ie. when to check)

Move-Selection Algorithms to Implement (in order):

- Expectiminimax
- Expectiminimax w/ pruning
(maybe just experiment w/ move ordering instead of MCTS)
- Monte Carlo
