Cribbage Implementation to finish:

- finish all the scoring functions
- integrate scoring functions into PLAY
- make SHOW segment of game
  - some of the same scoring functions but w/ different inputs


Move-Selection Algorithms to Implement (in order):

- Expectiminimax
- Expectiminimax w/ pruning
(maybe just experiment w/ move ordering instead of MCTS)
- Monte Carlo
